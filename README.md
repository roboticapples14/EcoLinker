# EcoLinker
EcoLinker is a tool to determine the most cost-effective allocation of restoration resources for maximizing habitat connectivity. This package serves as a more practical interface for Government + conservation agencies + decision makers who want to utilize EcoScape and other connectivity models to inform real conservation decisions. The program takes as input the habitat, connectivity and flow layers for a set of birds, a budget (dollar amount) for restoration, terrain, and a terrain conversion cost map (the dollar amount of converting one type of terrain to another). Its objective is to find the optimal terrain conversion for maximizing habitat connectivity.
